## Unfiltered Experiment
Welcome to my social experiment project. The user will get to choose from 4 tests (videos) which were handpicked to make them feel (connect) and visualize. I want my users to come in with an empty mind and record their responses to the content shown. I want to show them how their initial responses relate to the Map of Consciousness.

> **Example of questions I'll ask users:**
> 1. How does this make you feel? Do not filter it.
> 2. Focus on the senses (sight / sound / smell / taste / touch). Choose one. What is mostly highlighted from observing this video? Do not filter it. (Example: the taste of salt).
> 3. Map of Consciousness. What emotion does this mostly bring up? [User will get a list to choose from]
